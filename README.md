[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoCode/cs2-lab0-hello-java/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoCode/cs2-lab0-hello-java/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This build will always fail because it has two examples of failing tests:
one based on the source code, and one based on an incorrect test.
The status badge is here just to demonstrate continuous integration (CI) via GitHub Actions.

# GitHub account creation and repository import

This is a one-time step.

1. Create a GitHub account (if you do not have one already).

1. Request the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/join) using your official Loyola email address (optional).

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom invite provided to you in Sakai.

1. Work on the project following [these steps](https://gist.github.com/klaeufer/869ed974791256297049dee2dd920414) except the "repository import" section, which GitHub Classroom already took care of.

# Submission

When your project is ready to grade, submit your complete GitHub Classroom repository URL including your GitHub userid on Sakai as an inline submission. 

# Grading criteria

Total 3.5 points:

- (1 point) submission of your GitHub repo's URL via Sakai (your repo should still show original project commit history - this automatically happens when you import this repo)
- (0.5 point) leave project structure intact
- (1 point) fix or remove the erroneous test(s)
- (1 point) make the other test(s) pass without modifying anything else in src/test

*To clarify, your submitted repo must include at least one commit that you made and pushed up to the GitHub server.*
